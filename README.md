A personal attempt to make a todoist like app with react, react-router, sass, bootstrap, react-use, etc

## Info 
This project is made using react with typescript as a framework important libraries along with their documentations are as follows:

- Coding in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html)

- For date managment [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

- For general components [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

- Currently only for the date calendar [MUI X Date picker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/)

- For styling [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

- Although redux is not used the reducer architecture is used for general state managment
